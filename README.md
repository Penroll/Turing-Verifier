# Turing-Verifier
Verifies an input to a deterministic, single tape Turing Machine

## Usage
When launched, a user can add a set of rules to the "rules" section of the app, and once the necessary criteria are met, the user can run the Turing Machine given an input. The application will report to the user whether the sample input accepted, rejected, or halted.
